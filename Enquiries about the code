## Question about t-SNE Embedding Alignment in CODE-AE

Hello,

Iâ€™m currently trying to reproduce the results of CODE-AE, and I had a question regarding the t-SNE visualizations shown in **Figure 1** of the paper.

Despite successfully training the model (with reasonable pretraining and adversarial loss curves), I was unable to reproduce similarly well-aligned embeddings. My t-SNE plots of the shared representations still show noticeable domain separation between CCLE and TCGA, unlike the figure presented in the paper.

My workflow was:
1. Running `generate_encoded_features.py` with `--train` and `--method` being `code_adv`
2. Visualizing the resulting `.csv` outputs using the provided `generate_plots.ipynb`

Everything else (losses, model setup) appears to be working as expected. May I ask if there are any specific hyperparameters, seeds, data preprocessing steps, or t-SNE settings that might be critical to achieving the aligned embeddings shown in the paper? I have so far used the exact given hyperparameters and code given in the repository.

Any guidance you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing this valuable work.

Best regards,  
Siying
